Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

Observer is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. 

Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
