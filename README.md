**Strategy** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
---------------------------------------------------
**Observer** is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically. 
----------------------------------------------------
**Decorator** is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
----------------------------------------------------
**Factory Method** defines a method, which should be used for creating objects instead of using a direct constructor call (new operator). Subclasses can override this method to change the class of objects that will be created.
----------------------------------------------------
Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle that allows transferring the control of objects and their dependencies from the main program to a container.
----------------------------------------------------
**Abstract Factory** is a creational design pattern, which solves the problem of creating entire product families without specifying their concrete classes.
----------------------------------------------------
**Singleton** is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.
